# machine-learning-approach-for-malware-detection

Virus detection is a fundamental problem in classification. Programs can be trained to identify and delete a malware. We build an antivirus script in Python by training classifiers to detect Portable executable (PE) format files (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable). The classifier problem applies 5 algorithms and predict by comparing the results.
